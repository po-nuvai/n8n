# Lead Generation Workflow

## Overview

This n8n workflow automates lead generation by searching for businesses based on location and industry using the Google Places API. It extracts valuable business information including names, phone numbers, websites, and addresses.

**ðŸš€ New: Automatic Pagination** - The workflow now fetches up to **60 leads per search** (previously 20) by automatically handling Google Places API pagination with proper delays between requests.

### What This Workflow Does

**Input:**
- Location (city, state, or full address)
- Industry/Business type (e.g., restaurants, dentists, lawyers, gyms)
- Search radius (in meters)

**Output:**
- Business Name
- Phone Number
- Website
- Physical Address
- Business Status (operational/closed)

---

## Prerequisites

3. **Google Places API enabled** with an API key

---

## Step 1: Set Up Google Cloud Platform (Free Tier)

### 1.1 Create a GCP Account

1. Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
2. Sign in with your Google account
3. If it's your first time, you'll get **$300 free credits** for 90 days

### 1.2 Create a New Project

1. Click on the project dropdown at the top of the page
2. Click **"New Project"**
3. Name your project (e.g., "Lead Generation")
4. Click **"Create"**

### 1.3 Enable Required APIs

### 1.4 Create API Credentials

1. Go to **APIs & Services** > **Credentials**
2. Click **"Create Credentials"** > **"API Key"**

## Workflow Architecture

### Node Breakdown

1. **Manual Trigger:** Starts the workflow when you click "Test workflow"
2. **Input Parameters:** Set location, industry, and radius
3. **Geocode Location:** Converts location name to GPS coordinates
4. **Extract Coordinates:** Parses geocoding response
5. **Search Places with Pagination:** Finds businesses matching criteria (automatically fetches all pages up to 60 results)
6. **Extract Place IDs:** Gets unique IDs for each business
7. **Get Business Details:** Fetches detailed info (phone, website, etc.)
8. **Format Lead Data:** Cleans and structures the output
9. **Aggregate Leads:** Combines all leads into final output

### Data Flow

```
Location + Industry â†’ Geocoding â†’ Coordinates â†’ Places Search â†’
Place IDs â†’ Details API â†’ Formatted Leads â†’ Aggregated Output
```

---

## Exporting and Using Leads

### Method 1: Copy JSON Output

1. Click on the **"Aggregate Leads"** node after execution
2. Click on the **"JSON"** tab
3. Copy the output data
4. Paste into your CRM, spreadsheet, or database

### Method 2: Add Export Nodes (Optional Enhancement)

You can extend this workflow by adding output nodes:

#### A. Export to Google Sheets
1. Add a **"Google Sheets"** node after "Aggregate Leads"
2. Configure to append rows to a spreadsheet
3. Map fields: business_name, phone, website, address

#### B. Export to CSV
1. Add a **"Spreadsheet File"** node
2. Set format to CSV
3. Download or save to storage

#### C. Export to Airtable/Database
1. Add **"Airtable"** or **"PostgreSQL"** node
2. Configure database connection
3. Insert leads as new records

---

## Customization Options

### Adjust Search Radius

Modify the `radius` parameter (in meters):
- **1000** = 1km (very local)
- **5000** = 5km (neighborhood)
- **10000** = 10km (city-wide)
- **50000** = 50km (regional)

**Max:** 50,000 meters (50km)

### Industry Keywords

Be specific with your industry search:
- Good: "Italian restaurants", "personal injury lawyers", "yoga studios"
- Too broad: "business", "services"

### Filter by Business Status

Add a filter node after "Format Lead Data" to exclude closed businesses:

```javascript
if ($json.business_status === 'OPERATIONAL') {
  return $json;
}
```

### Add Email Extraction (Advanced)

Google Places API doesn't provide emails directly. To add email finding:

1. Add a **"HTTP Request"** node to scrape the website
2. Use regex to extract emails from website content
3. Common pattern: `/[a-zA-Z0-9._%+-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+\.[a-zA-Z]{2,}/`

**Note:** Email scraping has legal considerations - ensure compliance with data protection laws.

## Troubleshooting

### Error: "Location not found"

**Solution:**
- Use more specific location (include city and state)
- Try coordinates instead: "40.7128,-74.0060"
- Verify spelling

### Error: "REQUEST_DENIED"

**Solution:**
- Check API key is correct
- Verify Places API and Geocoding API are enabled in GCP
- Check API key restrictions allow these APIs

### Error: "OVER_QUERY_LIMIT"

**Solution:**
- You've exceeded free tier limits
- Check usage in GCP Console
- Wait for monthly reset or enable billing

### No Results Returned

**Solution:**
- Increase search radius
- Use different industry keywords
- Try a more populated location
- Check if businesses exist in that area

### Missing Phone/Website Data

**Solution:**
- This is normal - not all businesses provide this info to Google
- Try different search criteria
- Consider alternative data sources for verification

---

## Best Practices

### 1. API Usage Optimization

- **Batch searches:** Group similar searches to minimize API calls
- **Cache results:** Save data locally to avoid duplicate searches
- **Use specific keywords:** Reduces irrelevant results

### 2. Data Quality

- **Verify leads:** Always validate phone/email before outreach
- **Check business status:** Filter out permanently closed businesses
- **Update regularly:** Business info changes; refresh leads periodically

### 3. Legal Compliance

- **GDPR/CCPA:** Ensure compliance when storing personal data
- **CAN-SPAM:** Follow regulations for email marketing
- **Do Not Call:** Check against DNC registries before calling

### 4. Cost Management

- **Set budget alerts** in GCP at $10, $50, $100
- **Monitor daily usage** in GCP Console
- **Use workflow sparingly** during testing
- **Disable workflow** when not in use

---

## Advanced Enhancements

### 1. Add Webhook Trigger

Replace manual trigger with webhook to run via API:
```
POST https://your-n8n.com/webhook/lead-generation

```

### 2. Schedule Regular Searches

Add a **"Schedule Trigger"** to run searches automatically:
- Daily: Update leads database
- Weekly: Discover new businesses
- Monthly: Refresh all data

### 3. Enrich with Additional Data

Add nodes to fetch:
- Social media profiles (LinkedIn, Facebook)
- Company reviews and ratings
- Business hours and photos
- Competitor analysis

### 4. Integration with CRM

Connect to popular CRMs:
- **Salesforce**
- **HubSpot**
- **Pipedrive**
- **Zoho CRM**

### 5. Lead Scoring

Add a **Code** node to score leads based on:
- Has website (+10 points)

   - Immediately rotate if compromised

4. **Monitor for unusual activity**
   - Check GCP logs regularly
   - Set up usage alerts
   - Review API call patterns

### Data Storage

- **Encrypt sensitive data** at rest
